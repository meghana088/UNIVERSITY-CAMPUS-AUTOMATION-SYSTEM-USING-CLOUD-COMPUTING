> An Online Placement & Internship automation web portal for MNIT Jaipur students using MEAN Stack (Node.js, AngularJs, Express.js & MongoDb)

Training & Placement Cell, MNIT Jaipur aims at building a strong interface between industry and the University for training and placement of students. To make recruitment session smoother for students, Training & Placement Cell has a web portal for handling the placement registration for companies visiting our campus.

## Motivation :
The motivation for doing this project was primarily to make recruitment session smoother for students & make the complete Placement Process paperless at MNIT Jaipur. This is my small contribution, as an MNITian, to the betterment of the system of Placements in MNIT Jaipur.

I am deeply thankful to T&P Authorities for approving my project to use as **Official Placement Portal - MNIT Jaipur**.
